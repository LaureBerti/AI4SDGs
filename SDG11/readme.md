## Introduction

Sea level rise is one of the most critical challenges in the era of climate change. Accurate forecasting of sea level patterns is essential for safeguarding coastal infrastructure, ecosystems, and human populations. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are powerful tools for time-series modeling, capable of capturing long-term dependencies in oceanic data. This non-exhaustive list compiles relevant resources to understand, design, and deploy LSTM-based models for predicting sea level changes.

## Conclusion

Sea level forecasting is both a scientific and humanitarian imperative. Leveraging LSTM architectures can greatly enhance our ability to anticipate and prepare for the long-term impacts of climate change. This List serves as a springboard into this multidisciplinary field—uniting AI, oceanography, and sustainability. Future research directions include: hybrid LSTM-transformer models, spatiotemporal uncertainty quantification, and deployment of models on edge devices for real-time buoy monitoring.
