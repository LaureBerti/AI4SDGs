## Introduction

Sea level rise is one of the most critical challenges in the era of climate change. Accurate forecasting of sea level patterns is essential for safeguarding coastal infrastructure, ecosystems, and human populations. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are powerful tools for time-series modeling, capable of capturing long-term dependencies in oceanic data. This list compiles high-quality resources to understand, prototype, and deploy LSTM-based models for predicting sea level changes.
