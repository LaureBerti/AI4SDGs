## Introduction
Climate negotiations are complex multi-party interactions involving diverse national interests, long-term incentives, and uncertain outcomes. These interactions can be modeled as **multi-agent systems**, where agents learn cooperative strategies under various constraints. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** offers powerful tools to simulate, analyze, and optimize such negotiations. From public goods games to global emission treaties, MARL helps model incentive structures, dynamic agreements, and emergent cooperation.

Key challenges MARL can help address:
- Incentive misalignment between sovereign actors
- Sustained long-term cooperation
- Agent heterogeneity in goals and capacities
- Partial observability and negotiation uncertainty
