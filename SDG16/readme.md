## Introduction

Predicting social conflicts—ranging from protests and civil unrest to broader geopolitical instability—is a growing field that leverages machine learning to inform peacebuilding and preventive action. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling relational and dynamic structures common in socio-political data (e.g., actor networks, temporal sequences, geographic clustering). By learning from both network structure and node attributes, GNNs enable fine-grained forecasting of social phenomena at scale.

## Conclusion

Predicting social conflict using Graph Neural Networks represents one of the most impactful frontiers in machine learning for social good. By modeling human interaction as evolving networks, we can generate early warnings, understand root causes, and drive informed policy. The future promises even greater potential with advances in:

- Dynamic heterogeneous graphs for longitudinal conflict prediction  
- Hybrid LLM + GNN architectures for multimodal data synthesis  
- Real-time GNN inference for global monitoring and early warning  
- Equity-driven AI systems for peacebuilding interventions

Let’s build systems that not only predict violence but help prevent it.
