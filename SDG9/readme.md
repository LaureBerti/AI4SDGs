## Introduction

Anomaly detection in IoT systems is a cornerstone of security, reliability, and operational efficiency. As billions of connected devices continuously generate data, identifying patterns that deviate from normal behavior becomes critical for preempting failures and security breaches. Among various machine learning methods, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—a type of feedforward artificial neural network—offers a flexible and powerful approach to detect anomalies due to its capability to model complex nonlinear relationships. This curated list explores how MLPs are applied in the IoT context, providing an educational and practical resource for learners and practitioners alike.
