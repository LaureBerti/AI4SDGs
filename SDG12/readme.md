## Introduction

Waste classification is a critical component of sustainable waste management and recycling systems. Traditional computer vision models require large labeled datasets, but zero-shot learning enables models to generalize to unseen categories using semantic understanding.

CLIP, developed by OpenAI, has revolutionized image-text understanding by aligning visual and textual information in a shared embedding space. Applying CLIP to waste classification enables scalable, label-free categorization of waste materials (plastic, metal, glass, etc.), making AI systems more flexible and deployable in real-world scenarios, especially in resource-constrained environments.
