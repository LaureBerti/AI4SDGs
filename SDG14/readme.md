## Introduction

Coral reefs are vital marine ecosystems that support immense biodiversity and provide critical services such as coastal protection and fisheries support. Monitoring reef health through imagery analysis is essential but traditionally manual annotation is laborious and requires expert knowledge.

Transfer learning — adapting pretrained deep learning models to new but related tasks — enables scalable, accurate automated annotation of coral reef images even when labeled data is scarce. This accelerates reef health assessments, species classification, and biodiversity mapping, aiding conservation efforts globally.

## Conclusion

Coral reefs face unprecedented threats that require fast, accurate, and scalable monitoring solutions. Automated annotation powered by transfer learning unlocks new potential for large-scale reef health assessment, species identification, and ecological research.

Future research should focus on multimodal sensing (combining imagery, acoustic, and chemical data), few-shot learning to classify rare coral species, 3D reconstruction of reef habitats, and robust models adaptable to diverse underwater environments.

By joining AI advances with marine ecology, we empower conservationists worldwide to better understand, protect, and restore coral reef ecosystems — a mission critical for our planet’s health and biodiversity.
