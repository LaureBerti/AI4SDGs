## Introduction

Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS‑SVM) offer efficient, robust regression and classification capabilities by solving linear equations instead of quadratic programming—making them ideal for environmental applications. In water sanitation contexts, LS‑SVM has been successfully applied to predict flow rates, pollutant levels, water quality indices, and contamination events using hydrological and sensor data :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
