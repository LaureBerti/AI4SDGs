## Introduction

CNN–LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short-Term Memory) models are hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate spatial feature extraction with temporal sequence modeling. In air pollution prediction, where pollutant concentrations depend on complex interactions among meteorological variables, emission sources, and historical trends, CNNs effectively capture spatial and local patterns from multivariate sensor data, while LSTMs model long-term temporal dependencies. By leveraging both spatial and temporal information, CNN–LSTM frameworks improve forecasting accuracy for pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, and O₃. Although these models show strong potential for supporting early warning systems, policy-making, and public health protection, their effectiveness depends on data quality, interpretability, and robustness under varying environmental conditions.

## Conclusion

CNN–LSTM–based air pollution prediction is a powerful approach for capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of atmospheric pollutants, addressing the limitations of traditional statistical models. However, challenges related to data sparsity, model interpretability, and generalization across regions must be carefully managed. The future lies in attention-enhanced CNN–LSTM architectures, transfer and federated learning, and multimodal data fusion (combining sensor data, meteorology, satellite imagery, and traffic information). Collaborative efforts among environmental scientists, data engineers, policymakers, and public health experts will be essential to develop reliable and actionable air quality forecasting systems.
