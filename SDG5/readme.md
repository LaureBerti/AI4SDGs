# Awesome List: Gender-Based Violence Detection from Tweets Using Attention-Based Bi-GRU

## Introduction
Gender-based violence (GBV) remains a critical social issue worldwide. Detecting instances of GBV from social media platforms like Twitter is essential for timely intervention and awareness. Using attention-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRU) allows for sophisticated natural language understanding by capturing contextual dependencies in text data and highlighting important features through attention mechanisms. This hybrid approach improves detection accuracy, making it a promising method for analyzing tweets related to GBV.
