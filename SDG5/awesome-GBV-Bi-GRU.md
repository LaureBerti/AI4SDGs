Awesome: Gender​-Based Violence Detection from Tweets using Attention​-Based Bi​-GRU

A curated collection of high-quality resources aimed at researchers, practitioners, and policymakers addressing Gender-Based Violence (GBV) detection on social media via attention-enhanced Bi​-GRU models.

🧠 Introduction

Gender-Based Violence (GBV) on social media is a critical concern—detecting it in tweets helps inform prevention and response efforts.Attention-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi​-GRUs) excel at understanding context and emotional nuance in short texts. Their bidirectional processing captures dependencies, while attention highlights key tokens indicating abuse or violence.
