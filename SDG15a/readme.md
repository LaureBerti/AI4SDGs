## Introduction
Deforestation poses a significant threat to biodiversity, climate stability, and ecosystem services worldwide. Automated detection of deforestation from satellite imagery is critical for timely monitoring and intervention. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in this domain due to their ability to extract complex spatial features from high-resolution images. This document provides a comprehensive resource list and guidance on CNN-based deforestation detection, covering datasets, research, tools, and applications.
