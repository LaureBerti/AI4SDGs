## Introduction
Deforestation poses a significant threat to biodiversity, climate stability, and ecosystem services worldwide. Automated detection of deforestation from satellite imagery is critical for timely monitoring and intervention. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in this domain due to their ability to extract complex spatial features from high-resolution images. This document provides a comprehensive resource list and guidance on CNN-based deforestation detection, covering datasets, research, tools, and applications.


## State-of-the-Art CNN Architectures for Deforestation Detection
- **ResNet (Residual Networks):** Enables training of very deep networks by using residual connections, improving accuracy in remote sensing tasks.  
- **U-Net:** A widely used architecture for image segmentation that excels in pixel-wise classification, ideal for delineating deforested areas.  
- **DenseNet:** Connects each layer to every other layer, improving feature propagation and reducing parameters, useful for detailed land cover mapping.  
- **SegNet:** Encoder-decoder architecture designed for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery.  
- **Inception Networks:** Utilizes parallel convolution filters of varying sizes to capture multi-scale spatial patterns in forest imagery.
