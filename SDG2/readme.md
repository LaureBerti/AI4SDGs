## Introduction

Crop disease detection is the application of machine learning and computer vision to identify plant pathologies using images. The accurate and timely diagnosis of plant diseases is vital to global food security, especially in resource-limited settings. Pre-trained deep learning models and ensemble methods significantly boost detection accuracy by transferring knowledge from large datasets and combining the strengths of multiple models.

## Conclusion

AI-powered crop disease detection is essential for transforming agriculture into a more resilient and efficient system. Pre-trained networks reduce the need for large annotated datasets, while ensemble learning improves generalization and robustness. The fusion of computer vision with plant pathology is not only technical progress — it’s a tool for empowering millions of farmers and ensuring global food security. Future research should explore mobile-friendly inference, multimodal fusion (e.g., satellite imagery + drone + soil sensors), explainability in model outputs, and global collaborative datasets that drive better results for all.
