## [🚨](#introduction)

Human trafficking is a global crisis affecting over 27 million people. AI, particularly deep learning, can play a transformative role in detecting, monitoring, and preventing trafficking activities. The Swin Transformer—a hierarchical vision transformer—enables powerful capabilities in image, video, and multimodal data analysis. This list is attempting to aggregate resources to support technical efforts in developing responsible, high-impact dep learning solutions against human trafficking.
