## Introduction

Personalized conversational tutoring systems represent the convergence of AI, education, and user modeling. They tailor instructional content and interactions based on a learner's unique background, preferences, and progress. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), these systems can now deliver highly adaptive, naturalistic, and pedagogically informed dialogues at scale.
